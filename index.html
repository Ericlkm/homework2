                Hi my name is Eric i'm 22 years old, from New York from there moved to Florida orlando and now i'm a student in a bootcamp for software engineering. This is a breif story about some jobs i had before making this career change and a little about myself as well.
                Before i started this bootcamp i was in and out of jobs going back and fourth, a couple of places i work at were funspot, a warehouse, a restaurant called boston market, restaurant depot, and a car lot at an airport.
                At first i started working to build up my resume so i can find a very good job that i can stick with and make a career out of it but i came to realize that these jobs were not for me and i have no interest or motivation to keep pursuing until i found coding. I went on the internet and starting searching careers that pay well and could be life changing no matter how challeging they are, I ran into the ucf coding bootcamp and sign up and put in my information and waited for them to call.
                Then from there i went through all the steps to get enrolled into this bootcamp and prepared to start my journey as a coder.
